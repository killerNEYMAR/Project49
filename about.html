A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back. Camels have long been domesticated and, as livestock, they provide food (milk and meat) and textiles (fiber and felt from hair). Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitat and are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo. There are three surviving species of camel. The one-humped dromedary makes up 94% of the world's camel population, and the two-humped Bactrian camel makes up 6%. The Wild Bactrian camel is a separate species and is now critically endangered.

You probably know that these lizards can change their skin color, but they’ve got plenty of other special tricks as well. In fact, they might be the world’s most talented reptiles. Chameleons can shoot out their tongues at alarming speeds, use their tails as extra limbs, and even see in two different directions at once. Impressive, no?
Most lizards have fairly unremarkable feet. In the majority of species, they're comprised of four to five toes that can move independently of each other—just as ours do. But evolution has taken chameleon limbs in a very different direction. A chameleon’s foot consists of two fleshy pads that oppose each other. One pad contains three digits that are fused together while the other has two fused digits.

Up in the tree canopies where they live, these feet come in handy. Like a set of pincers, the opposing pads on each foot firmly clamp down onto vines and branches. Also, whereas most lizards have sprawling limbs, chameleons usually hold their legs almost directly underneath their bodies. This gives them an athletic gait for a modern reptile—walking this way keeps the center of gravity directly above the feet, which helps the animals stay balanced.

The domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica) is a pigeon subspecies that was derived from the rock dove (also called the rock pigeon). The rock pigeon is the world's oldest domesticated bird. Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets mention the domestication of pigeons more than 5,000 years ago, as do Egyptian hieroglyphics.Research suggests that domestication of pigeons occurred as early as 10,000 years ago.


The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo),[5] also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear native to south central China.It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.[7] Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.

Cicadas have prominent eyes set wide apart, short antennae, and membranous front wings. They have an exceptionally loud song, produced in most species by the rapid buckling and unbuckling of drumlike tymbals. The earliest known fossil Cicadomorpha appeared in the Upper Permian period; extant species occur all around the world in temperate to tropical climates. They typically live in trees, feeding on watery sap from xylem tissue and laying their eggs in a slit in the bark. Most cicadas are cryptic. The vast majority of species are active during the day as adults, with some calling at dawn or dusk. Only a rare few species are known to be nocturnal.


A teddy bear is a stuffed toy in the form of a bear. Developed apparently simultaneously by toymakers Morris Michtom in the U.S. and Richard Steiff in Germany in the early years of the 20th century, and named after President Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt, the teddy bear became a popular children's toy, celebrated in story, song, and film.[1] Since the creation of the first teddy bears which sought to imitate the form of real bear cubs, "teddies" have greatly varied in form, style, color, and material. They have become collector's items, with older and rarer "teddies" appearing at public auctions.Teddy bears are among the most popular gifts for children and are often given to adults to signify love, affection, congratulations, or sympathy.
